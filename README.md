This PHP Authentication System allows users to sign up and log in using a MySQL database for secure credential storage.  
Features:
✅ User Registration – Allows users to sign up with a username, email, and password (passwords are securely hashed).
✅ User Login – Authenticates users against the database and starts a session.
✅ Session Management – Keeps users logged in across pages until they log out.
✅ Secure Password Storage – Uses password hashing (bcrypt) to store passwords securely.

This system serves as a basic foundation for any web application requiring user authentication with PHP and MySQL
